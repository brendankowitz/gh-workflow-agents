# GH-Workflow-Agents Vision

## Purpose

GH-Workflow-Agents is a self-maintaining GitHub repository experiment that uses AI agents to autonomously manage software development lifecycle tasks. The goal is to minimize human intervention while maintaining code quality, security, and feature development.

## Core Principles

1. **Autonomous Operation** - Agents should operate with minimal human oversight
2. **Quality First** - All changes must pass automated reviews and tests
3. **Security by Default** - Security vulnerabilities are highest priority
4. **Vision Alignment** - Features should align with project goals before implementation
5. **Transparency** - All agent decisions should be logged and auditable

## Goals

- Automated issue triage and classification
- AI-powered code review for all pull requests
- Proactive dependency updates and security patching
- Research-driven feature suggestions aligned with industry trends
- Automatic assignment of actionable issues to Copilot coding agent

## Non-Goals

- Manual code reviews for automated changes
- Complex multi-repository orchestration
- Support for programming languages other than TypeScript/JavaScript
- GUI or web interface components

## Architecture

The system consists of three main agents:

1. **Research Agent** - Analyzes dependencies, security, and industry trends
2. **Triage Agent** - Classifies and prioritizes issues
3. **Review Agent** - Reviews pull requests for quality and security

## Success Metrics

- Issues triaged within 5 minutes of creation
- Pull requests reviewed within 10 minutes
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- 90%+ of actionable issues successfully assigned to Copilot
